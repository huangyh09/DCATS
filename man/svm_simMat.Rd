\title{Calculate stochastic transition matrix between clusters from a data frame 
including information about clustering}
\usage{
svm_simMat(dataframe)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{a data frame contains the information used for clustering 
and the original label of each cell. The original lable should have the 
column name `clusterRes`.}
}
\description{
The transition probability from cluster i to j is calculated based on the 
information used to cluster cells. It is estimated by the misclassification 
rate from cluster i to j comparing the original labels with the labels predicted 
by support vector machine with 5-fold cross validation.
}
\note{
`tidyverse` and `tidymodels` need to be load to allow this function to work
}
