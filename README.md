This R package contains methods to detect the differential composition
abundances between multiple conditions in singel-cell experiments.

## Installation

### From R

The **latest** `DCATS` package can be conveniently installed using the
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/)
package thus:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("huangyh09/DCATS", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

#### For development

Download this repository to your local machine and open it in Rstudio as
a project, and build it by install and restart.

## Getting started

The best place to start are the vignettes. From inside an R session,
load `DCATS` and then browse the vignettes:

``` r
library(DCATS)
browseVignettes("DCATS")
```
